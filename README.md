Never run af update again!  Use appfrog to upload your site to AppFog with no trouble!
Use the Wordpress mini-plugin to avoid ever having to use af update in the first place!  If you have a wordpress site uploaded, put this inside the first <?php of any php file in the plugin editor area.  Then check to make sure yoursite.af.cm/upload.php returns a blank page.
